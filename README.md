Hi üëãüèΩ

My name is Meghana, or Meg for short, pronouns are she/her

I am based in London, UK and am currently looking for new opportunities in the data analytics field.

My most recent experience was as a data analyst for a large media company based back in my home country of New Zealand but prior to that I worked in the public sector.

Some project highlights include:
-

- Creating an automated reporting dashboard to show subscribers and subscriptions for all print publications produced by the company. This involved joining multiple tables using SQL and pulling the data through to Power BI for visualisation.
  One particular pain point was writing a DAX query which accounted for start and end dates to show active accounts at any period selected by the user, however after trial and error, this was achieved. Another success was geographically mapping subscribers and their subscriptions to their regions, towns/cities and suburbs.
  This meant loading in publicly accessible geographical data, cleaning the CRM data and mapping accordingly. 
- Creating an automated dashboard to show website page views, unique visitors and other digital metrics. A key standout from this dashboard was an overview page showing all the tracked site metrics alongside a dynamic period-on-period comparison.
  The user was able to choose any period (day-on-day, week-on-week etc.) for comparison or could choose specific dates instead. 
- Another highlight for me is scoping out projects, even if they remain in the backlog. Scoping projects allows me to connect with stakeholders, determine data sources, seek out data pipeline opportunities and work with colleagues in the data space.
  Even if it doesn't lead to a green lit project, these scoping exercises allow me to work with different data types and expands my knowledge base.
